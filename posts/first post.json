{"title": "A Blog Post About This Blog\n", "date": "4/11/23\n", "id": 1, "content": "<p>Welcome to my blog! </p>\n<p>Here I will (try to) make posts often about some projects that I am working on or just post anything else that I wanted to write about. I will try and post often enough and, later, I may even change up the site a bit.</p>\n<p>I've always wanted to make a blog but never got to it as it seemed like too big of a task. This is one of the reasons I decided to stick to this simple layout. The idea of a blog was partially inspired by one of my friend's blog. You can check his website out at <a href=\"https://www.johnlozier.com/\">johnlozier.com</a> (it's really neat). </p>\n<p>The first thing you might be thinking is \"This website looks basic.\" Well, luckily,  that was just the style I was going for. I am trying to make it look like the styling of the old old internet. Recently I found 2 very old computers in my attic and a box of floppy discs to run on them (which I may write an article about later), inspiring this theme. I might change up the styling a bit later but, for now, I will keep the table layout.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"First version of the blog\" src=\"../static/first_blog.png\" title=\"First version of the blog\" /></p>\n<p><em>The first (and current) version of this blog</em></p>\n<p>To add to the theme of an older webpage, I decided to challenge myself by not using any Javascript. I almost ended up not using css either, but I decided against it. The entire website is rendered on the server, including the \"... see more\"s (which took a while to get working) and the posts on the home page.</p>\n<p>As of now, this is just a side project of mine so I may not work on designing the webpage as much, but it has been fun so far with my limited front-end experience. Thanks for reading, see you in the next post!</p>\n<p>(I may try and implement comments later, so look forward to that : ) )</p>"}
